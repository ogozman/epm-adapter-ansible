# What's on this image?


The adapter is implemented using **python2.7** and the ansible and gRPC libraries.


# How to use this image


To start the adapter in a docker container run this command:
```bash
docker run -p 50052:50052 --expose 50052 -i -t epm-adapter-ansible
```

If you want to start both the Elastest Platform Manager and the Ansible adapter you can use this [docker-compose](https://github.com/elastest/elastest-platform-manager/blob/master/docker-compose-epm.yml).



This will create the docker container for both the adapter and the EPM and will also automatically register the adapter to the EPM, so you can start using them straight away.


The package has to be a **tar** file and has to have the following structure:

```bash
- metadata.yaml #Simple metadata file that should include the name of the package
- docker-compose.yml #The docker-compose file
```

This is an example **Metadata** file:
```yaml
name: example-name
type: ansible
```
